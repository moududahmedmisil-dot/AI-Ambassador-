🐛 Troubleshooting
Chatbot not responding with visa information?
Solution: Clear browser cache and reload:

Open DevTools (F12)
Application tab → IndexedDB → Delete AIAmbassadorDB
Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
Build errors with Tailwind CSS?
Solution: Ensure you're using Tailwind CSS v3 (not v4):

npm install -D tailwindcss@^3.0.0 postcss autoprefixer
Dataset not loading?
Solution: Check browser console for errors. The app falls back gracefully:

Tries to load from IndexedDB cache
Falls back to fetching from Hugging Face
Falls back to verified local data only
Never fails completely
